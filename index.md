# Part 2
#### For the second part of the lab, I created some files such as `.gitignore` and `PRIVATE.txt`
>The steps are as follows:

1. I created **PRIVATE.txt**
   -then wrote my full name and PID number in this file
2. Then I created another file called **.gitignore**
   -this file ignores the files which are given to it
      -then I wrote **PRIVATE.txt** in the file
3. I used the **Source Control**
   -using Source control helps staging the changes, commit and push the changes I made to files in my repo

>The following picture shows the exact step before I hit the commit button:
